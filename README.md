# ðŸš¨ Wildlife Defense System ðŸŒ¿

## Project Overview
An intelligent, Raspberry Pi-based system designed to detect and deter wildlife from entering protected areas using computer vision and automated defense mechanisms.

## ðŸ›  Hardware Requirements
- Raspberry Pi 3 or 4
- Qubo Security Camera (with RTSP support)
- Low-voltage Electric Fence
- 12V/220V Strobe Light
- Alarm Speaker
- Relay Modules
- Power Supply
- Jumper Wires & Breadboard

## ðŸ“¦ Software Dependencies
- Raspbian OS
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics YOLO
- RPi.GPIO

## ðŸš€ Installation Steps

### 1. Prepare Raspberry Pi
```bash
# Run initial setup script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/setup.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### 2. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wildlife-defense-system.git
cd wildlife-defense-system
```

### 3. Configure Settings
Edit `config.yaml` to set:
- Camera RTSP URL
- Detection Sensitivity
- Target Animal List

### 4. Run the System
```bash
python3 wildlife_defense.py
```

## ðŸ”§ Customization
- Adjust `confidence_threshold`
- Modify `target_animals` list
- Add more defense mechanisms

## ðŸš¨ Safety Warnings
- Ensure electric fence complies with local regulations
- Use low-voltage configurations
- Implement proper electrical insulation

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements
- Cloud logging
- Remote monitoring
- Machine learning model improvements

### Wiring Diagram Explanation

Here's a textual description of the wiring for your reference:

1. **Raspberry Pi GPIO Pins**:
   - Pin 18 (GPIO 18): Strobe Light Relay
   - Pin 23 (GPIO 23): Alarm Speaker Relay
   - Pin 24 (GPIO 24): Electric Fence Relay
   - GND: Connected to relay module ground

2. **Relay Module Connections**:
   - Relay IN pins connected to specified GPIO pins
   - COM (Common) pins connected to power source
   - NO (Normally Open) pins connected to device power input
